A growing collection of practical automation and diagnostic scripts for IT support, system administration, and endpoint management across macOS (JAMF), Linux, and Windows environments.

## 📖 Purpose

This repository represents my hands-on learning journey in IT support and systems administration.

As I continue developing deeper expertise in macOS administration, JAMF environments, Linux systems, and Windows support, I use this space to document the tools, scripts, and workflows that improve troubleshooting efficiency and operational reliability.

The goal is twofold:

- 📌 Build repeatable, documented troubleshooting workflows  
- 📌 Create a reference library for myself and others  

I strongly believe that good IT professionals do not just solve problems — they document solutions so they can be reused, improved, and shared.

## 🧠 My Learning Philosophy

Every script in this repository represents:

1. A real troubleshooting scenario  
2. A problem-solving approach  
3. A documented solution  
4. An opportunity for improvement  

Instead of repeatedly solving the same issues manually, I aim to:

- Automate repetitive diagnostics  
- Standardize support workflows  
- Reduce resolution time  
- Build scalable troubleshooting tools  

Documentation ensures that knowledge compounds over time rather than being lost.

## 🤝 Why Documentation Matters

In IT environments, undocumented fixes create repeated work.

By documenting scripts and workflows:

- Troubleshooting becomes faster  
- Onboarding becomes easier  
- Knowledge becomes transferable  
- Systems become more stable  

This repository is both a personal reference and a shared resource for anyone building practical IT automation skills.
